I am now a master student of computer science in Zhejiang University [KG Lab](https://www.zjukg.org/), advised by Prof. [Huajun Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T6om-m4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Prof. [Wen Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ig9ho4kAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My research interest includes **Multi-modal Knowledge Graph**, **Large Language Models**, and their application in real scenarios. I have published several papers at the top conferences such as SIGKDD, ICDE, ACM MM, ISWC, IJCNN, NLPCC.

I have a online noteboook (mainly in Chinese) on [this link](https://zhang-each.github.io/My-CS-Notebook/) to share my learning notes and daily life.

I am on the job market now, **looking for a summer intership position** about large language models. If you are interested in my research work, you can contact me through my email.
